# Projects
There are three projects overall, and all are related to data analysis or machine learning. 

## Clustering
In this project I described and showed three different clustering algorithm. I showed why normalization is essential in clustering and what are advantages and disadvatages of individual algorithms.

## PCA
It is always nice to have many features, because we can then describe higher varience in data. But it has some disadvantages too. Model is easily overfited, training time can be too high and visualization is harder. In this project I am trying to show how you can reduce number of features and still retain as much information as possible.

## Flight price prediction

In this project I showed how to pick the best parameters for a model based on cross validation. Based on this technique I was able to trained Random forest regressor to predict fligh prices with low error.
